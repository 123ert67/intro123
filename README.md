Hi in this post will contains 2 file (not include this one )
1. profile (my personal profile)
2. a simple game call "Pong NOOB AI debsirin" (its just a pong game with a simple physics of bouncing ball with a NOOB Newbie AI that will keep you busy for a while)

What did I learn from developing this game?
1. Basic Game Development Concepts:
   - Game Loop: Understanding how the game loop works, which continuously updates the game state and renders the game visuals.
   - Event Handling: Learning how to handle user inputs such as key presses and button clicks to control game elements.

2. Python Programming Skills:
   - Variables and Data Types: Using different data types such as integers, floats, and lists to manage game state.
   - Functions: Defining and using functions to organize code and handle specific tasks like drawing on the canvas, updating positions, and handling inputs.
   - Global Variables: Managing global variables to maintain the state of the game across different functions.

3. SimpleGUI Library:
   - Creating a Frame: Setting up the game window using simplegui.create_frame.
   - Drawing on Canvas: Using the draw handler to render game elements like paddles, ball, and scores.
   - Event Handlers: Setting up keydown and keyup handlers to respond to user inputs and control the paddles.

4. Game Physics:
   - Collision Detection: Implementing collision detection for the ball with the paddles and walls.
   - Velocity and Position Updates: Understanding how to update the position of game elements based on their velocity and handling boundary conditions.

5. AI Implementation:
   - Basic AI: Implementing a simple AI to control the second paddle in single-player mode, making it follow the ball.

6. Code Organization and Modularity:
   - Modular Code: Writing modular code by separating different functionalities into distinct functions, making the code easier to read and maintain.
   - Initialization and Reset: Implementing functions to initialize and reset the game state, such as new_game and spawn_ball.
